Bibliometric techniques are not yet widely used to enhance retrieval processes in digital libraries, although they offer value-added effects for users. On the other side, more and more information professionals, working in libraries and archives are confronted with applying bibliometric techniques in their services. This way knowledge exchange becomes more urgent. The first workshop set the research agenda, by introducing in each other methods, reporting about current research problems and brainstorming about common interests. This follow-up workshop continues the overall communication, but also puts one problem into the focus. In particular, we will explore how statistical modelling of scholarship can improve retrieval services for specific communities, as well as for large, cross-domain collections like Mendeley or ResearchGate. This second BIR workshop continues to raise awareness of the missing link between Information Retrieval (IR) and bibliometrics and contributes to create a common ground for the incorporation of bibliometric-enhanced services into retrieval at the scholarly search engine interface.},

However, in most cases explicit links that would provide readers with direct access to referenced datasets are missing. Manually detecting references to datasets in papers is time consuming and requires an expert in the domain of the paper. In order to make explicit all links to datasets in papers that have been published already, we suggest and evaluate a semi-automatic approach for finding references to datasets in social sciences papers. Our approach does not need a corpus of papers (no cold start problem) and it performs well on a small test corpus (gold standard). Our approach achieved an F-measure of 0.84 for identifying references in full texts and an F-measure of 0.83 for finding correct matches of detected references in the da{\textbar}ra dataset registry.},

This paper focuses on homonym names in the computer science bibliography DBLP. The goal of this study is to implement and evaluate a method which uses co-authorship networks in order to disambiguate homonym names, especially common names. The results show that the implemented method has a good performance and can be used for author name disambiguation of sparse bibliographic records.},

While we see a clear difference in the content between the head and the tail of the search engine result list we see no statistical significant differences in the binary relevance judgments and weak significant differences when using graded relevance. The tail contains different but still valuable results. We argue that the long tail can be a rich source for the diversification of web search engine result lists but it needs more evaluation to clearly describe the differences.},

We conducted an online survey with 129 participating researchers from different fields of study that aims at getting a quantitative view on the usage of high level search activities in DLs. Although our results indicate the usefulness of high-level search activities, they are not well supported by modern DLs with regards to the users' state of search, e.g. looking at a relevant or not relevant document. Furthermore, we identified differences in the information seeking behavior across the respondents.

The randomness was introduced to reduce potential biases in the assessment.

This list covers all types of activities and pages that can be carried out/visited within the system (e.g. typing a query, visiting a document, selecting a facet, etc.). For each action, a session id, the date stamp and additional information (e.g. queries, document ids, and result lists) are stored. The session id is assigned via browser cookie and allows tracking user behaviour over multiple searches. Based on the session id and date stamp, the step in which an action is conducted and the length of the action is included in the data set as well. The data set contains 558,008 individual search sessions and a total of 7,982,427 logs entries. The average number of actions per search session is 7.},

	abstract = {Stereotype and most-popular recommendations are widely neglected in the research-paper recommender-system and digital-library community. In other domains such as movie recommendations and hotel search, however, these recommendation approaches have proven their effectiveness. We were interested to find out how stereotype and most-popular recommendations would perform in the scenario of a digital library. Therefore, we implemented the two approaches in the recommender system of GESIS' digital library Sowiport, in cooperation with the recommendations-as-a-service provider Mr. DLib. We measured the effectiveness of most-popular and stereotype recommendations with click-through rate (CTR) based on 28 million delivered recommendations. Most-popular recommendations achieved a CTR of 0.11\%, and stereotype recommendations achieved a CTR of 0.124\%. Compared to a “random recommendations” baseline (CTR 0.12\%), and a content-based filtering baseline (CTR 0.145\%), the results are discouraging. However, for reasons explained in the paper, we concluded that more research is necessary about the effectiveness of stereotype and most-popular recommendations in digital libraries.},

We will highlight important questions one should ask before setting up a data collection framework and relate them to the different options for accessing social media data. The chapter will mainly be illustrated with examples from studying Twitter and Facebook. A case study studying political communication around the 2013 elections in Germany should serve as a practical application scenario. In this case study we constructed several social media datasets based on different collection approaches, using data from Facebook and Twitter.},

The treatment of homonyms is crucial for the reliable resolution of author names. Apart from varying handling of first, middle and last names, vendors as well as the digital library community created tools to address the problem of author name disambiguation. This technical report focuses on two widespread collections of scientific literature, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, and the coverage with author identification information such as Researcher ID, ORCID and Scopus Author Identifier in the period 1996 - 2014. The goal of this study is to describe the significant differences of the two collections with respect to overall distribution of author identifiers and its use across different subject domains. We found that the STM disciplines show the best coverage of author identifiers in our dataset of 6,032,000 publications which are both covered by WoS and Scopus. In our dataset we found 184,823 distinct ResearcherIDs and 70,043 distinct ORCIDs. In the appendix of this report we list a complete overview of all WoS subject areas and the amount of author identifiers in these subject areas.},

	abstract = {Scholarly document creation continues to face various obstacles. Scholarly text production requires more complex word processors than other forms of texts because of the complex structures of citations, formulas and figures. The need for peer review, often single-blind or double-blind, creates needs for document management that other texts do not require. Additionally, the need for collaborative editing, security and strict document access rules means that many existing word processors are imperfect solutions for academics. Nevertheless, most papers continue to be written using Microsoft Word (Sadeghi et al. 2017). We here analyze some of the problems with existing academic solutions and then present an argument why we believe that running an open source academic writing solution for academic purposes, such as Fidus Writer, on a Network Attached Storage (NAS) server could be a viable alternative.},

We performed a preliminary analysis of their frequency and stage of use in the social sciences search engine sowiport. In addition, we explored the impact of these stratagems on the whole search process performance. We can conclude that the appearance of these two search features in real retrieval sessions lead to an improvement of the precision in terms of positive interactions with 16\% when using footnote chasing and 17\% for the citation search stratagem.},

Taking serious account of these factors has major implications for not only evaluation methods and metrics, but also for the nature of the data that is necessary both for understanding and modeling information search, and for evaluation of personalized support for information retrieval (IR). In this position paper, we: present a model of IR demonstrating why these factors are important; identify some implications of accepting their validity; and, on the basis of a series of studies in interactive IR, identify some types of data concerning searcher and system behavior that we claim are, at least, necessary, if not necessarily sufficient, for meaningful evaluation of personalization of IR.},

	abstract = {At the very beginning of compiling a bibliography, usually only basic information, such as title, authors and publication date of an item are known. In order to gather additional information about a specific item, one typically has to search the library catalog or use a web search engine. This look-up procedure implies a manual effort for every single item of a bibliography. In this technical report we present a proof of concept which utilizes Linked Data technology for the simple enrichment of sparse metadata sets. This is done by discovering owl:sameAs links between an initial set of computer science papers and resources from external data sources like DBLP, ACM and the Semantic Web Conference Corpus. In this report, we demonstrate how the link discovery tool Silk is used to detect additional information and to enrich an initial set of records in the computer science domain. The pros and cons of silk as link discovery tool are summarized in the end.},

Search-Term-Recommendation (STR) systems can help to overcome these problems. This paper evaluates the benefits that may be gained from the use of STRs in Query Expansion (QE). We create 17 STRs, 16 based on specific disciplines and one giving general recommendations, and compare the retrieval performance of these STRs. The main findings are: (1) QE with specific STRs leads to significantly better results than QE with a general STR, (2) QE with specific STRs selected by a heuristic mechanism of topic classification leads to better results than the general STR, however (3) selecting the best matching specific STR in an automatic way is a major challenge of this process.},

	title = {Toward a {Semantic} {Citation} {Index} for the {German} {Social} {Sciences}},
	url = {http://www.uni-regensburg.de/bibliothek/bibliometrie/index.html},
	abstract = {GESIS, the Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Germany, provides more or less open access to a number of databases that either document social science research that takes place in Germany, or that document research literature of interest to that community. Due to the nature of social science research, there is a large overlap between these two sets: social science research is to a significant extent regional in scope; and its findings are mainly published in books or reports. Coverage of the international social sciences in citation indexes is therefore notoriously low, and despite the existence of a Social Sciences Citation Index and the recent launch of a Book Citation Index at Thomson Reuters, this is not likely to change significantly anytime soon. This does not mean that citations are of no importance in these fields, however. Quite to the contrary, in fact: based on Google Scholar results, citations to the works of Jürgen Habermas, Max Weber, or Niklas Luhmann are nearly as frequent as those to the works of Noam Chomsky, for example, reputedly one of the most highly cited authors ever. GESIS has therefore begun work on putting together a citation index for the German social sciences. Besides enabling serious bibliometric and scientometric studies of the social sciences in Germany, this citation index will add citation index functionality to the Sowiport portal. To the extent allowed by legal constraints, the growing citation graph will also be made available in RDF form in the Linked Open Data cloud; the full dataset, including all restricted content, will be available to interested visiting researchers at GESIS's Application Laboratory Web 3.0. Given the scarcity of citation data for the social sciences, the bulk of this citation index will be produced semi-automatically from digital full text versions of the relevant social science literature. Two pilot studies for extracting references from full text were started in 2011; one uses the Social Sciences Open Access Repository texts as a corpus, the other, the full 100 years' worth of proceedings of the German Sociological Society general meetings. Negotiations to allow processing of large collections of digital versions of relevant texts are also underway. Nevertheless, existing social science citation index data will be incorporated (and used for quality control), e.g., data available in the Proquest Cambridge Scientific Abstracts social science research literature databases, which GESIS hosts as part of a nation-wide licensing scheme. Here, experiments are underway to semi-automatically map between reference strings and their corresponding full bibliographic records, and to build an online citation index from the result.},

	abstract = {Links between citing and cited documents are essential for bibliometric analysis: Evaluative bibliometrics uses the citation frequencies of documents as a proxy for their impact, descriptive bibliometrics as representations of cognitive linkage between documents, co-citation and bibliographic coupling data help in describing knowledge flows based on citation links. However, the limitations and biases of the technical procedures applied in generating and standardizing reference data as well as in the subsequent matching of references to target documents have received limited attention in the recent development of bibliometric methods. While there are some new approaches on a conceptual level, little “hands-on” experience is available yet. By outlining and comparing our experiences (Dinkel 2011, Strotmann et al. 2011) in cleaning, standardizing, and matching references from Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, and Cambridge Sociological Abstracts (CSA) we will examine the limitations and potentials of these data sources. In our contribution we will provide an introduction into historical trajectories in reference matching, a description and comparison of the structure and quality of references in WOS, Scopus and CSA, a comparison of methods for standardizing and normalizing the references for different document types, a description of limitations and potentials of deterministic and probabilistic approaches at different stages of reference matching and a description of techniques for data handling and storage. By making available experiences and methods in building a custom citation index we aim at fostering the understanding of the technical and conceptual limitations of “out-of-the-box” data provided in WOS and Scopus. Furthermore we provide starting points for the extension of citation analysis with data sources beyond WOS and Scopus.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe the evaluation of the effectiveness of the bibliometric technique Bradfordizing in an information retrieval (IR) scenario. Bradfordizing is used to re-rank topical document sets from conventional abstracting \& indexing (A\&I) databases into core and more peripheral document zones. Bradfordized lists of journal articles and monographs will be tested in a controlled scenario consisting of different A\&I databases from social and political sciences, economics, psychology and medical science, 164 standardized IR topics and intellectual assessments of the listed documents. Does Bradfordizing improve the ratio of relevant documents in the first third (core) compared to the second and last third (zone 2 and zone 3, respectively)? The IR tests show that relevance distributions after re-ranking improve at a significant level if documents in the core are compared with documents in the succeeding zones. After Bradfordizing of document pools, the core has a significant better average precision than zone 2, zone 3 and baseline. This paper should be seen as an argument in favour of alternative non-textual (bibliometric) re-ranking methods which can be simply applied in text-based retrieval systems and in particular in A\&I databases.},

The search process typically can be separated into three major phases: query formulation and refinement, browsing through result lists and viewing and interacting with documents and their properties. We discuss a selection of popular visualization techniques that have been developed for the different phases to support the user during the search process. Along prototypes based on the different techniques we show how the approaches have been implemented. Although various visualizations have been developed in prototypical systems very few of these approaches have been adapted into today's DLs. We conclude that this is most likely due to the fact that most systems are not evaluated intensely in real-life scenarios with real information seekers and that results of the interesting visualization techniques are often not comparable. We can say that many of the assessed systems did not properly address the information need of current users.},

	abstract = {Information systems usually show as a particular point of failure the vagueness between user search terms and the knowledge orders of the information space in question. Some kind of guided searching therefore becomes more and more important in order to precisely discover information without knowing the right search terms. Knowledge maps of digital library collections are promising navigation tools through knowledge spaces but still far away from being applicable for searching digital libraries. However, there is no continuous knowledge exchange between the "map makers" on the one hand and the Information Retrieval (IR) specialists on the other hand. Thus, there is also a lack of models that properly combine insights of the two strands. The proposed workshop aims at bringing together these two communities: experts in IR reflecting on visual enhanced search interfaces and experts in knowledge mapping reflecting on visualizations of the content of a collection that might also present a context for a search term in a visual manner. The intention of the workshop is to raise awareness of the potential of interactive knowledge maps for information seeking purposes and to create a common ground for experiments aiming at the incorporation of knowledge maps into IR models at the level of the user interface.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe a case study where researchers in the social sciences (n=19) assess topical relevance for controlled search terms, journal names and author names which have been compiled automatically by bibliometric-enhanced information retrieval (IR) services. We call these bibliometric-enhanced IR services Search Term Recommender (STR), Journal Name Recommender (JNR) and Author Name Recommender (ANR) in this paper. The researchers in our study (practitioners, PhD students and postdocs) were asked to assess the top n pre-processed recommendations from each recommender for specific research topics which have been named by them in an interview before the experiment. Our results show clearly that the presented search term, journal name and author name recommendations are highly relevant to the researchers' topic and can easily be integrated for search in Digital Libraries. The average precision for top ranked recommendations is 0.75 for author names, 0.74 for search terms and 0.73 for journal names. The relevance distribution differs largely across topics and researcher types. Practitioners seem to favor author name recommendations while postdocs have rated author name recommendations the lowest. In the experiment the small postdoc group (n=3) favor journal name recommendations.},

	abstract = {In digital libraries recommendations can be valuable for researchers, e.g. recommending related literature to a given context. Typically, in a scientific context the simple presentation of related content is not sufficient. Often the users demand a more detailed view on the connection of a document and its specific recommendations. The aim of pennants introduced by Howard White (2007) is to provide the user with a graph showing the relatedness / distance between a given document and related documents. Co-citation but also co-occurrence analysis are established methods for finding related documents to a seed. A seed could be for instance an author, a keyword, or a publication. In this paper we introduce a recommender system in the digital library sowiport using pennant diagrams which can be created from co-citation and/or co-occurrence analysis. The presentation at the NKOS workshop will present demos of pennants in sowiport and will elaborate on practical questions in visualizing pennants and evaluating the utility of pennants for search.},

Tweets were collected for candidates of all covered parties except the AfD. All data was publicly available at the time of data collection. Cases in which a Twitter or Facebook account was not used as part of the role as a candidate (i.e., private accounts and accounts merely used for private postings) were not included. Due to legal reasons only the following data can be shared: (1) A list of all candidates that were considered in the project, their key attributes and if available the identification of their Twitter and Facebook accounts. (2) A list of Tweet-IDs which can be used to retrieve the original tweets of the candidates which they posted between June and December 2013.

In our study we looked at the following features: average editing time, the average number of papers in an issue and the editor effort measured on presorted issues as relative search length (RSL). We found an average issue size of 12.4 documents per issue. The average editing time is rather low with 14.5 minute. We get to the point that the success of a report is mainly driven by its topic and the number of subscribers, as well as proactive action by the editor to promote the report in her community.},

This paper focuses on homonym names in the computer science bibliography DBLP. The goal of this study is to evaluate a method which uses co-authorship networks and analyze the effect of common names on it. For this purpose we clustered the publications of authors with the same name and measured the effectiveness of the method against a gold standard of manually assigned DBLP records. The results show that despite the good performance of implemented method for most names, we should optimize for common names. Hence community detection was employed to optimize the method. Results prove that the applied method improves the performance for these names.},

Analysing the users’ past interactions with the system is one typical approach. In this paper, we analyse the user behaviour in retrieval sessions towards Marcia Bates’ search stratagems such as “Footnote Chasing”, “Citation Searching”, “Keyword Searching”, “Author Searching” and “Journal Run” in a real-life academic search engine. In fact, search stratagems represent high-level search behaviour as the users go beyond simple execution of queries and investigate more of the system functionalities. We performed analyses of these five search stratagems using two datasets extracted from the social sciences search engine sowiport. A specific focus was the detection of the search phase and frequency of the usage of these stratagems. In addition, we explored the impact of these stratagems on the whole search process performance. We addressed mainly the usage patterns’ observation of the stratagems, their impact on the conduct of retrieval sessions and explored whether they are used similarly in both datasets. From the observation and metrics proposed, we can conclude that the utilisation of search stratagems in real retrieval sessions leads to an improvement of the precision in terms of positive interactions. For both datasets (SUSS 14–15 and SUSS 16–17), the user behaviour was similar as all stratagems appear most frequently in the middle of a session. However, the difference is that “Footnote Chasing”, “Citation Searching” and “Journal Run” appear mostly at the end of a session while Keyword and Author Searching appear typically at the beginning. Thus, we can conclude from the log analysis that the improvement of search functionalities including personalisation and/or recommendation could be achieved by considering references, citations, and journals in the ranking process.},
