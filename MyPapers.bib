abstract = {In this paper we present the results of a user study on exploratory search activities in a social science digital library. We conducted a user study with 32 participants with a social sciences background -- 16 postdoctoral researchers and 16 students -- who were asked to solve a task on searching related work to a given topic. The exploratory search task was performed in a 10-minutes time slot. The use of certain search activities is measured and compared to gaze data recorded with an eye tracking device. We use a novel tree graph representation to visualise the users' search patterns and introduce a way to combine multiple search session trees. The tree graph representation is capable to create one single tree for multiple users and to identify common search patterns. In addition, the information behaviour of students and postdoctoral researchers is being compared. The results show that search activities on the stratagem level are frequently utilised by both user groups. The most heavily used search activities were keyword search, followed by browsing through references and citations, and author searching. The eye tracking results showed an intense examination of documents metadata, especially on the level of citations and references. When comparing the group of students and postdoctoral researchers we found significant differences regarding gaze data on the area of the journal name of the seed document. In general, we found a tendency of the postdoctoral researchers to examine the metadata records more intensively with regards to dwell time and the number of fixations.},

abstract = {Scholarly document creation continues to face various obstacles. Scholarly text production requires more complex word processors than other forms of texts because of the complex structures of citations, formulas and figures. The need for peer review, often single-blind or double-blind, creates needs for document management that other texts do not require. Additionally, the need for collaborative editing, security and strict document access rules means that many existing word processors are imperfect solutions for academics. Nevertheless, most papers continue to be written using Microsoft Word (Sadeghi et al. 2017). We here analyze some of the problems with existing academic solutions and then present an argument why we believe that running an open source academic writing solution for academic purposes, such as Fidus Writer, on a Network Attached Storage (NAS) server could be a viable alternative.},

abstract = {As digital collections of scientific literature are widespread and used frequently in knowledge-intense working environments, it has become a challenge to identify author names correctly. The treatment of homonyms is crucial for the reliable resolution of author names. Apart from varying handling of first, middle and last names, vendors as well as the digital library community created tools to address the problem of author name disambiguation. This technical report focuses on two widespread collections of scientific literature, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, and the coverage with author identification information such as Researcher ID, ORCID and Scopus Author Identifier in the period 1996 - 2014. The goal of this study is to describe the significant differences of the two collections with respect to overall distribution of author identifiers and its use across different subject domains. We found that the STM disciplines show the best coverage of author identifiers in our dataset of 6,032,000 publications which are both covered by WoS and Scopus. In our dataset we found 184,823 distinct ResearcherIDs and 70,043 distinct ORCIDs. In the appendix of this report we list a complete overview of all WoS subject areas and the amount of author identifiers in these subject areas.},

abstract = {In the area of Linked Open Data (LOD) meaningful and high-performance interlinking of different datasets has become an ongoing challenge. Necessary tasks are supported by established standards and software, e.g. for the transformation, storage, interlinking and publication of data. Our use case Swissbib is a well-known provider for bibliographic data in Switzerland representing various libraries and library networks. In this article, a case study is presented from the project linked.swissbib.ch which focuses on the preparation and publication of the Swissbib data by means of LOD. Data available in Marc21 XML is extracted from the Swissbib system and transformed into an RDF/XML representation. From the approx. 21 million monolithic records the author information is extracted and interlinked with authority files from the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) and DBpedia. The links are used to extract additional data from the counterpart corpora. Afterwards, data is pushed into an Elasticsearch index to make the data accessible for other components. As a demonstrator, a search portal is developed which presents the additional data and the generated links to users. In addition to that, a REST interface is developed in order to enable also access by other applications. A main obstacle in this project is the amount of data and the necessity of day-to-day (partial) updates. In the current situation the data in Swissbib and in the external corpora are too large to be processed by established linking tools. The arising memory footprint prevents the correct functioning of these tools. Also triple stores are unhandy by revealing a massive overhead for import and update operations. Hence, we have developed procedures for extracting and shaping the data into a more suitable form, e.g. data is reduced to the necessary properties and blocked. For this purpose, we used sorted N-Triples as an intermediate data format. This method proved to be very promising as our preliminary results show. Our approach could establish 30,773 links to DBpedia and 20,714 links to VIAF and both link sets show high precision values and could be generated in reasonable expenditures of time.},

In other domains such as movie recommendations and hotel search, however, these recommendation approaches have proven their effectiveness. We were interested to find out how stereotype and most-popular recommendations would perform in the scenario of a digital library. Therefore, we implemented the two approaches in the recommender system of GESIS' digital library Sowiport, in cooperation with the recommendations-as-a-service provider Mr. DLib. We measured the effectiveness of most-popular and stereotype recommendations with click-through rate (CTR) based on 28 million delivered recommendations. Most-popular recommendations achieved a CTR of 0.11{\%}, and stereotype recommendations achieved a CTR of 0.124{\%}. Compared to a “random recommendations” baseline (CTR 0.12{\%}), and a content-based filtering baseline (CTR 0.145{\%}), the results are discouraging. However, for reasons explained in the paper, we concluded that more research is necessary about the effectiveness of stereotype and most-popular recommendations in digital libraries.},

abstract = {Today, full-texts of scientific articles are often stored in different locations than the used datasets. Dataset registries aim at a closer integration by making datasets citable but authors typically refer to datasets using inconsistent abbreviations and heterogeneous metadata (e.g. title, publication year). It is thus hard to reproduce research results, to access datasets for further analysis, and to determine the impact of a dataset. Manually detecting references to datasets in scientific articles is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge in the underlying research domain. We propose and evaluate a semi-automatic three-step approach for finding explicit references to datasets in social sciences articles. We first extract pre-defined special features from dataset titles in the da|ra registry, then detect references to datasets using the extracted features, and finally match the references found with corresponding dataset titles. The approach does not require a corpus of articles (avoiding the cold start problem) and performs well on a test corpus. We achieved an F-measure of 0.84 for detecting references in full-texts and an F-measure of 0.83 for finding correct matches of detected references in the da|ra dataset registry.},

This paper focuses on homonym names in the computer science bibliography DBLP. The goal of this study is to evaluate a method which uses co-authorship networks and analyze the effect of common names on it. For this purpose we clustered the publications of authors with the same name and measured the effectiveness of the method against a gold standard of manually assigned DBLP records. The results show that despite the good performance of implemented method for most names, we should optimize for common names. Hence community detection was employed to optimize the method. Results prove that the applied method improves the performance for these names.},

We conducted an online survey with 129 participating researchers from different fields of study that aims at getting a quantitative view on the usage of high level search activities in DLs. Although our results indicate the usefulness of high-level search activities, they are not well supported by modern DLs with regards to the users' state of search, e.g. looking at a relevant or not relevant document. Furthermore, we identified differences in the information seeking behavior across the respondents.

abstract = {The BIR workshop brings together experts of Bibliometrics and Information Retrieval. While sometimes perceived as rather loosely related, they share various interests and face similar challenges. Our motivation as organizers of the BIR workshop stemmed from a twofold observation. First, both communities are only partly overlapping albeit sharing various interests. Second, knowledge transfer would be profitable for both sides to tackle some of the emerging problems scholars face nowadays when they have to deal with identifying relevant and high quality literature among the very fast growing number of electronic publications available worldwide. Bibliometric techniques are not yet widely used to enhance retrieval processes in digital libraries, although they offer value-added effects for users. Information professionals working in libraries and archives, however, are increasingly confronted with applying bibliometric techniques in their services. The first workshop in 2014 set the research agenda by introducing each other state-of-the-art methods, reporting on current research problems, and brainstorming about common interests. The second workshop in 2015 continued the overall communication and reunification. This third BIR workshop continues to foster a common ground for the incorporation of bibliometric-enhanced services into scholarly search engine interfaces. In particular we address specific communities, as well as studies on large, cross-domain collections like Mendeley and ResearchGate.

abstract = {Users of web search engines are known to mostly focus on the top ranked results of the search engine result page. While many studies support this well known information seeking pattern only few studies concentrate on the question what users are missing by neglecting lower ranked results. To learn more about the relevance distributions in the so-called long tail we conducted a relevance assessment study with the Million Short long-tail web search engine. While we see a clear difference in the content between the head and the tail of the search engine result list we see no statistical significant differences in the binary relevance judgments and weak significant differences when using graded relevance. The tail contains different but still valuable results. We argue that the long tail can be a rich source for the diversification of web search engine result lists but it needs more evaluation to clearly describe the differences.},

Authors typically make references to datasets by mentioning them for example by using their titles and the year of publication. However, in most cases explicit links that would provide readers with direct access to referenced datasets are missing. Manually detecting references to datasets in papers is time consuming and requires an expert in the domain of the paper. In order to make explicit all links to datasets in papers that have been published already, we suggest and evaluate a semi-automatic approach for finding references to datasets in social sciences papers. Our approach does not need a corpus of papers (no cold start problem) and it performs well on a small test corpus (gold standard). Our approach achieved an F-measure of 0.84 for identifying references in full texts and an F-measure of 0.83 for finding correct matches of detected references in the da|ra dataset registry.},

This way knowledge exchange becomes more urgent. The first workshop set the research agenda, by introducing in each other methods, reporting about current research problems and brainstorming about common interests. This follow-up workshop continues the overall communication, but also puts one problem into the focus. In particular, we will explore how statistical modelling of scholarship can improve retrieval services for specific communities, as well as for large, cross-domain collections like Mendeley or ResearchGate. This second BIR workshop continues to raise awareness of the missing link between Information Retrieval (IR) and bibliometrics and contributes to create a common ground for the incorporation of bibliometric-enhanced services into retrieval at the scholarly search engine interface.},

In our study we looked at the following features: average editing time, the average number of papers in an issue and the editor effort measured on presorted issues as relative search length (RSL). We found an average issue size of 12.4 documents per issue. The average editing time is rather low with 14.5 minute. We get to the point that the success of a report is mainly driven by its topic and the number of subscribers, as well as proactive action by the editor to promote the report in her community.},

abstract = {In digital libraries recommendations can be valuable for researchers, e.g. recommending related literature to a given context. Typically, in a scientific context the simple presentation of related content is not sufficient. Often the users demand a more detailed view on the connection of a document and its specific recommendations. The aim of pennants introduced by Howard White (2007) is to provide the user with a graph showing the relatedness / distance between a given document and related documents. Co-citation but also co-occurrence analysis are established methods for finding related documents to a seed. A seed could be for instance an author, a keyword, or a publication. In this paper we introduce a recommender system in the digital library sowiport using pennant diagrams which can be created from co-citation and/or co-occurrence analysis. The presentation at the NKOS workshop will present demos of pennants in sowiport and will elaborate on practical questions in visualizing pennants and evaluating the utility of pennants for search.},

We call these bibliometric-enhanced IR services Search Term Recommender (STR), Journal Name Recommender (JNR) and Author Name Recommender (ANR) in this paper. The researchers in our study (practitioners, PhD students and postdocs) were asked to assess the top n pre-processed recommendations from each recommender for specific research topics which have been named by them in an interview before the experiment. Our results show clearly that the presented search term, journal name and author name recommendations are highly relevant to the researchers' topic and can easily be integrated for search in Digital Libraries. The average precision for top ranked recommendations is 0.75 for author names, 0.74 for search terms and 0.73 for journal names. The relevance distribution differs largely across topics and researcher types.

@inproceedings{Mutschke2014b,
abstract = {Information systems usually show as a particular point of failure the vagueness between user search terms and the knowledge orders of the information space in question. Some kind of guided searching therefore becomes more and more important in order to precisely discover information without knowing the right search terms. Knowledge maps of digital library collections are promising navigation tools through knowledge spaces but still far away from being applicable for searching digital libraries. However, there is no continuous knowledge exchange between the "map makers" on the one hand and the Information Retrieval (IR) specialists on the other hand. Thus, there is also a lack of models that properly combine insights of the two strands. The proposed workshop aims at bringing together these two communities: experts in IR reflecting on visual enhanced search interfaces and experts in knowledge mapping reflecting on visualizations of the content of a collection that might also present a context for a search term in a visual manner. The intention of the workshop is to raise awareness of the potential of interactive knowledge maps for information seeking purposes and to create a common ground for experiments aiming at the incorporation of knowledge maps into IR models at the level of the user interface.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an overview of several visualization techniques to support the search process in Digital Libraries (DLs). The search process typically can be separated into three major phases: query formulation and refinement, browsing through result lists and viewing and interacting with documents and their properties. We discuss a selection of popular visualization techniques that have been developed for the different phases to support the user during the search process. Along prototypes based on the different techniques we show how the approaches have been implemented. Although various visualizations have been developed in prototypical systems very few of these approaches have been adapted into today's DLs. We conclude that this is most likely due to the fact that most systems are not evaluated intensely in real-life scenarios with real information seekers and that results of the interesting visualization techniques are often not comparable. We can say that many of the assessed systems did not properly address the information need of current users.},

Our research focuses on social media communication related to the 2013 election of the German parlia-ment [translation: Bundestagswahl 2013]. We constructed several social media datasets using data from Facebook and Twitter. First, we identified the most relevant candidates (n=2,346) and checked whether they maintained social media accounts. The Facebook data was collected in November 2013 for the period of January 2009 to October 2013. On Facebook we identified 1,408 Facebook walls containing approximately 469,000 posts. Twitter data was collected between June and December 2013 finishing with the constitution of the government. On Twitter we identified 1,009 candidates and 76 other agents, for example, journalists. We estimated the number of relevant tweets to exceed eight million for the period from July 27 to September 27 alone. In this document we summarize past research in the literature, discuss possibilities for research with our data set, explain the data collection procedures, and provide a description of the data and a discussion of issues for archiving and dissemination of social media data.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe the evaluation of the effectiveness of the bibliometric technique Bradfordizing in an information retrieval (IR) scenario. Bradfordizing is used to re-rank topical document sets from conventional abstracting {\&} indexing (A{\&}I) databases into core and more peripheral document zones. Bradfordized lists of journal articles and monographs will be tested in a controlled scenario consisting of different A{\&}I databases from social and political sciences, economics, psychology and medical science, 164 standardized IR topics and intellectual assessments of the listed documents. Does Bradfordizing improve the ratio of relevant documents in the first third (core) compared to the second and last third (zone 2 and zone 3, respectively)? The IR tests show that relevance distributions after re-ranking improve at a significant level if documents in the core are compared with documents in the succeeding zones. After Bradfordizing of document pools, the core has a significant better average precision than zone 2, zone 3 and baseline. This paper should be seen as an argument in favour of alternative non-textual (bibliometric) re-ranking methods which can be simply applied in text-based retrieval systems and in particular in A{\&}I databases.},

abstract = {Links between citing and cited documents are essential for bibliometric analysis: Evaluative bibliometrics uses the citation frequencies of documents as a proxy for their impact, descriptive bibliometrics as representations of cognitive linkage between documents, co-citation and bibliographic coupling data help in describing knowledge flows based on citation links. However, the limitations and biases of the technical procedures applied in generating and standardizing reference data as well as in the subsequent matching of references to target documents have received limited attention in the recent development of bibliometric methods. While there are some new approaches on a conceptual level, little “hands-on” experience is available yet. By outlining and comparing our experiences (Dinkel 2011, Strotmann et al. 2011) in cleaning, standardizing, and matching references from Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, and Cambridge Sociological Abstracts (CSA) we will examine the limitations and potentials of these data sources. In our contribution we will provide an introduction into historical trajectories in reference matching, a description and comparison of the structure and quality of references in WOS, Scopus and CSA, a comparison of methods for standardizing and normalizing the references for different document types, a description of limitations and potentials of deterministic and probabilistic approaches at different stages of reference matching and a description of techniques for data handling and storage. By making available experiences and methods in building a custom citation index we aim at fostering the understanding of the technical and conceptual limitations of “out-of-the-box” data provided in WOS and Scopus. Furthermore we provide starting points for the extension of citation analysis with data sources beyond WOS and Scopus.},

@inproceedings{Dinkel2012,
abstract = {GESIS, the Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Germany, provides more or less open access to a number of databases that either document social science research that takes place in Germany, or that document research literature of interest to that community. Due to the nature of social science research, there is a large overlap between these two sets: social science research is to a significant extent regional in scope; and its findings are mainly published in books or reports. Coverage of the international social sciences in citation indexes is therefore notoriously low, and despite the existence of a Social Sciences Citation Index and the recent launch of a Book Citation Index at Thomson Reuters, this is not likely to change significantly anytime soon. This does not mean that citations are of no importance in these fields, however. Quite to the contrary, in fact: based on Google Scholar results, citations to the works of J{\"{u}}rgen Habermas, Max Weber, or Niklas Luhmann are nearly as frequent as those to the works of Noam Chomsky, for example, reputedly one of the most highly cited authors ever. GESIS has therefore begun work on putting together a citation index for the German social sciences. Besides enabling serious bibliometric and scientometric studies of the social sciences in Germany, this citation index will add citation index functionality to the Sowiport portal. To the extent allowed by legal constraints, the growing citation graph will also be made available in RDF form in the Linked Open Data cloud; the full dataset, including all restricted content, will be available to interested visiting researchers at GESIS's Application Laboratory Web 3.0. Given the scarcity of citation data for the social sciences, the bulk of this citation index will be produced semi-automatically from digital full text versions of the relevant social science literature. Two pilot studies for extracting references from full text were started in 2011; one uses the Social Sciences Open Access Repository texts as a corpus, the other, the full 100 years' worth of proceedings of the German Sociological Society general meetings. Negotiations to allow processing of large collections of digital versions of relevant texts are also underway. Nevertheless, existing social science citation index data will be incorporated (and used for quality control), e.g., data available in the Proquest Cambridge Scientific Abstracts social science research literature databases, which GESIS hosts as part of a nation-wide licensing scheme. Here, experiments are underway to semi-automatically map between reference strings and their corresponding full bibliographic records, and to build an online citation index from the result.},

abstract = {Interactive visualizations for exploring and retrieval have not yet become an integral part of digital libraries and information retrieval systems. We have integrated a set of interactive graphics in a real world social science digital library. These visualizations support the exploration of search queries, results and authors, can filter search results, show trends in the database and can support the creation of new search queries. The use of weighted brushing supports the identification of related metadata for search facets. In a user study we verify that users can gain insights from statistical graphics intuitively and can adopt interaction techniques.},

@unpublished{Schaible2012,
abstract = {At the very beginning of compiling a bibliography, usually only basic information, such as title, authors and publication date of an item are known. In order to gather additional information about a specific item, one typically has to search the library catalog or use a web search engine. This look-up procedure implies a manual effort for every single item of a bibliography. In this technical report we present a proof of concept which utilizes Linked Data technology for the simple enrichment of sparse metadata sets. This is done by discovering owl:sameAs links between an initial set of computer science papers and resources from external data sources like DBLP, ACM and the Semantic Web Conference Corpus. In this report, we demonstrate how the link discovery tool Silk is used to detect additional information and to enrich an initial set of records in the computer science domain. The pros and cons of silk as link discovery tool are summarized in the end.},
